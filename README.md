# Syntaxonomy
The word Syntaxonomy is to bridge a collection (taxonomy) of languages (syntax). In this instance this website is the cumulative assortment of useful links and articles I have found over 20+ years of Web Development. Consider these the must-reads, the insightful philosophies, and the fundamentals. All have been stacked into categories based upon the order you might learn about them through your career.
